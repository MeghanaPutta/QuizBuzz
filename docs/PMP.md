# Project Quality Management Plan:

Quality Management Plan is about maintaining the quality throughout the project that is at deliverables and processes along with allocating the responsibility to different people in the project to meet the requirements of the clients. 

Metrics:

Some of the measures of quality are as follows.,
- Number of bugs per test=Total number of defects/Total number of tests
- Number of tests run per time period=Number of tests run/Total time
- Test design efficiency=Number of tests designed/Total time
- Bug find rate=Total number of defects/Total number of test hours
- Test review efficiency=Number of tests reviewed/Total time
- Passed Test Cases Percentage= (Number of Passed Tests/Total number of tests executed)*100
- Failed Test Cases Percentage= (Number of Failed Tests/Total number of tests executed)*100
- Fixed Defects Percentage= (Defects Fixed/Defects Reported)*100
- Critical Defects Percentage= (Critical Defects/Total Defects Reported)*100
- Rework Effort Ratio= (Actual rework efforts spent in that phase/total actual efforts spent in that phase)*100

Roles and responsibilities:

Name | Role | Quality Responsibility |

# Project Communication Management Plan:
Communication is crucial for every project success. Planning is the way to communicate your path through time to complete a series of tasks. Communication could be through mails, hangouts, Messages, phone calls..etc. Communication controls to ensure the stakeholder to meet the requirements.

Contents in the project communication management plan are as follows.,

- 1. Information to be communicated, including format, content, and level of detail :-

The information to be communicated for a project through email, seminars, conferences etc. The schedule for the communication plan can be created on Gantt Chart. The confidential information of the project can be shared through Google Docs and Github.

- 2. Who will receive the information and who will produce it :-
 
The information related to the project will be communicated with the project manager through Emails or phone calls. According to the communication management plan the project information is shared to the project manager if there are any changes in the project.

- 3. Suggested methods or technologies for conveying the information :-

Communication management plan can be shared using collaborative tools like SharePoint portal, Google Docs, for this we need to authorize out team members to edit the documents and make sure to share the information to right people.

- 4. Frequency of communication :-

If the project team members will be in the same location then they need to communicate through the face-to-face meetings for better communication. If they are in different locations then they need to communicate through the video calls to rectify there errors when they run the code. Project status meetings are conducted on weekly basis and scrum meetings are held on daily basis with all the stakeholders.

- 5. Escalation procedures for resolving issues :-

For resolving issues in the project we need to report to the higher authority.
The issues are created and tracked by using different tools.

- 6. Revision procedures for updating the communications management plan :-

We can use collaborative tools like SharePoint Portals, Google Docs to share the documents among the team members.

- 7. A glossary of common terminology :-

Stakeholder - The people who involved in or affected by the project’s activities.
Escalation - The process which details how conflicts and issues will be passed to the higher authority.

- 8. Stakeholder communications requirements :-
